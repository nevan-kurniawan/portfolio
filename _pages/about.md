I am a fifth-semester Computer Science undergraduate at Binus University, specializing in the theory and application of neural networks. My primary research interest lies in novel architecture design, with a focus on creating more efficient and adaptable models. My most significant project to date is a from-scratch implementation of Mixture-of-Experts LoRA (MoE-LoRA) modules within Vision Transformer architectures.

My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in the core mathematics of machine learning, including linear algebra and calculus, as well as advanced algorithm design. I have practical experience in translating these theoretical concepts into working implementations using Python and core deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

My long-term objective is to pursue a Ph.D. and a career in research, contributing to the development of more general and capable AI systems. I am actively seeking research assistantships and collaborative opportunities. Please feel free to review my work in the projects section or contact me via email.
